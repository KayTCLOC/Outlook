## API Documentation
As part of the assignment requirements, a **fake API project** has been created using Swagger (OpenAPI).
- The API is documented in [`swagger.yaml`](./swagger.yaml).
- It defines **two endpoints** to demonstrate how Outlook functionality could be exposed via an API:
  1. `GET /emails` – Retrieve a list of emails (fake data).
  2. `POST /emails` – Send a new email (fake data).

These endpoints are not connected to a real Outlook service. They are **documented examples** to illustrate API design and documentation practices.
